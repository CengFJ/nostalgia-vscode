nostalgia-vscode (for macOS)

The icons of VSCode 1.17 look ugly (issue #35783 on VSCode's github repo).

The following files are from VSCode 1.16:

- `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/Code.icns`
- `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/code_file.icns`
- `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/resources/letterpress-dark.svg`
- `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/resources/letterpress-hc.svg`
- `/Applications/Visual Studio Code.app/Contents/Resources/app/resources/letterpress.svg`

> Acknowledgement: `Code2.icns` was created by **@1|0** ([here](https://github.com/1l0/logo/tree/master/vscode)). Thanks!
